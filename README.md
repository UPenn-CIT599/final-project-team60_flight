final-project-team60_flight created by GitHub Classroom

The project gives advice when the user is planning a trip. 

First, a list of popular cities is provided. The user can choose one of interest and decide a departure date.

Depending on the user's expectation of the trip duration, he can choose to view a weather forecast of 5, 10 or 15 days. Or he can take a peek of the city's current weather, of course.

If the user has decided the city and departure date, the project will search for the most inexpensive flight, direct or not, and display details for both. After that, he can also choose a return date and view the price.
