The program allows the user to search flights to one of the top 10 popular destinations and check their weather conditions. If the user is not interested in any of the suggested cities, they also have the option to put their desired destination. 

API keys were erased from source code files. Users are welcome to try the program with Runnable.jar.

In the Java program, there are three tabs. The first tab provides a list of popular cities. The user can choose one of the listed popular cities and enters their current city, current country, departure and returning dates. After hitting "Enter", the program will then populate the cheapest flight's price, the number of lay-overs, a link to book the flight, and the departure and arrival times of both outbound and inbound flights.

Troubleshoot:
If an error message is displayed, and the user believes the information they put in is correct, the user will need to hit the "Enter" button until a flight information is displayed. This error usually occurs when the user sends requests to the Skyscanner API too frequently.

The second tab of the Java program allows the user to check the weather conditions of any popular cities that are listed in "Popular_cities.csv". After entering the name of a popular city and hitting "Enter", the program will populate 5 days of weather forecast of the city.
