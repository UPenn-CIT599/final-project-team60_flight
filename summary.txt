“Spur-of-the-moment Trip” is a handy tool that provides pieces of information for users willing to have a short trip. The user chooses one of the popular cities for travelers and specifies the dates for a round trip. The program then provides two kinds of information with details: a 5-day weather forecast of the destination city and the most inexpensive flights available. The user can also search for other desired cities if needed.

Siva Ho is responsible for implementing the cheapest flights API and the GUI interface.

Xueying Li is responsible for implementing the weather forecast API, unit tests and exception handling.
